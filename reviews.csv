0,This phone is amazing I got one for my 13 year old and one for my eleven year old and I'm about to buy one for myself! Thus phone is amazingly cheap but it still works well. It has a great camera and a light weight. It is very secure and has a great scratch resistant screen. The picture on the screen was also always clear and easy to see.,1
1,This isn't a flagship phone but very adequate for the price tag. The screen is a little slow but it may be due to screen protector. Provides everything I need for a really great price,1
2,"I got this smartphone as an alternative to a.) Getting my iPhone 12 pro scrubbed.
b.) buying another iPhone.
To explain, I got hacked while using my iPhone and my bank wanted me to get it scrubbed in case there was some sort of malware on it. So rather than driving 40 minutes and paying $190 to get that done along with the paperwork certifying it was done, I just bought a brand new Samsung A-15 from Amazon. It performs well and satisfied my bank. Price is probably the .ain't factor in my purchasing this phone. I think I owned a Galaxy S-21 before, and I like this A-15 better. It has no water resistance, one speaker, but it has decent cameras and is fast enough loading internet sites. It's a tad big and heavy, but the + side is a larger screen. There is no inductive charging, but it uses a 25 watt charger that makes charging relatively fast. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I think it's 5000 miliamps. I've had it last over 3 days, so that's a plus. If you are an iOS user and have Apple Mail, that can be challenging, but once you set everything up, it's no big deal.",0
3,"I decided to wait to write a review because I was on the fence about keeping it or not. My previous phone was a Samsung A10E which is not a very heavy phone. The A15 is considerably heavier which I am (still) not very comfortable with. Comparing the 2 phones as far as memory is concerned is markedly different. The A10E has 32 gigs of internal memory. The A15 has 128 gigs of internal memory. Considering that I have alot of pics on my phone with several different albums, this makes the A15 a better product. The battery life is quite good. The appearance is beautiful. I purchased the light blue phone. I have a clear cover on my phone. This is my 4th Samsung cell phone. Samsung never disappoints with quality, durability and performance. I love the Samsung Smart Switch which makes moving your data from one phone to another fast and super easy. They don't provide a SIM card or micro SD card so you need to make sure to move your cards into your new phone. The software is similar to previous Samsung phone with a few tweaks. For example, to get a screen shot for the A15 you need to press both power and volume down button simultaneously. What makes the A15 different from any of my previous Samsungs is with the A15 you have to press each twice. There is a feature that would put a floating icon on your screen and open it and tap screenshot then you will get your screenshot. Now, what sold me on the A15 is a neat feature where, upon your approval, they will block all spam/scam phone calls. So no more annoying spam/scam calls!! It's a neat feature!! Like I said, I love Samsung phones!!",1
4,"Switched to this from a Samsung Galaxy S9, which was a much more expensive phone in its day (about 5 years ago), because I wanted to run an app that required a newer version of Android. I couldn't bring myself to spend what the Galaxy S series sell for these days so I opted for the A15.

I'll admit that it's unfair to compare a 5yo phone to a new one, but I'm really impressed with this phone compared to the S9 especially at this price point. It adds 5G, bigger screen, and better cameras along with the newer OS features. Because it's unlocked, you can choose your phone and your carrier independently. (I never liked having to commit to both at the same time.)",1
5,"For my uses this phone is a great deal. I use it as a phone, for email, to text, to access the internet, for Zoom, to navigate, to take photos, and a bunch of lesser things like controlling my alarm system and thermometer, reading the Washington Post etc. What I don’t do is game and social media.
The most important things I want in a phone are that it does what I need, which it does, and that it be stable and robust – it’s a Samsung -- nuf said.
I had been using a Samsung Galaxy J7 for the past five years but finally decided that it just didn’t have enough memory so I got the A15 which has about 4x more memory and seems perfectly adequate. Aside from inadequate memory, my old J7 worked perfectly and still does.
I see some complaints about the A15 being slow. It seems fine for my uses, but you’ve probably guessed by now that I’m not exactly a tech expert, power user type. I can tell you that videos and Zoom operate smoothly. It may not work very well for high demand functions like gaming, but I wouldn’t know.
I opted for the US version for $200 rather than the international version for $20 or $30 less because I didn’t want to mess around with any possible compatibility issues with my cell service provider. Speaking of cost: for my uses, why would I spend 4 to 6 times more for a high-end phone -- really?
The battery seems fine. I let it charge at night but it so far has never gone below 80% during an average day’s use. The screen is large and sharp and the cameras seem to do a fine job. I could only wish that it was smaller and lighter and that it had cordless charging but for the price I’m not complaining.

FYI: The phone weighs 7.57 oz (0.47lbs) and the dimensions are 6 ¼” x 3”",1
6,"Yes it works, but I have complaints! The touch-screen is the biggest problem, it is unresponsive and inexact. VERY INEXACT. The battery life is pretty good, but not as good as my Moto-G. And it gets really bad call reception in my area if it's not set to wi-fi calling. I do live in a very remote location, but still, what the heck? My old phone worked! My husband's phone works! It's a phone, shouldn't its primary function be making and receiving calls? (Oh, I just betrayed my age, didn't I?)
That's all my complaints. Those caveats aside, it has good smartphone functionality and it's sturdy. It is also extremely affordable.
I'm afraid I had high expectations. Because they are the premier Android brand, I expected a low-level Samsung to be at least as good as a mid-level Motorola. NO. That is NOT the case. I will be going back to a Moto-G when this phone reaches the end of its usefulness. And I will try to take better care of the next one!",0
7,"After being an Apple customer for several years, I am starting to get tired of constantly having to get a new phone at a cost of about $1000 every few years. My phones tend to last longer than the software upgrades allow. I still have a working iPhone 3GS that can be used. I even bought a SIMM conversion kit to test it. It still works, but not much good for anything else but playing my music library.

This phone is my delve into the Android world, and at a little over $200 this phone seems to work great. I only did the basic setup, and haven’t logged it into any accounts like Google or Samsung, but I can insert the SIMM card, and use it like an old fashioned phone, should my aging iPhone 8 fail on me. Right now, I am trying to decide about whether to shell out for another Apple product or just go with Samsung, like a lot of others have done, according to recent news about how Apple is losing market share to Samsung.

After I get a chance to play around with the phone a little more, I will probably update this review.",1
8,"I purchased this phone to replace a Samsung phone from 2015. It is definitely much faster. My only complaint is it does not have the same sound notifications, which I miss. There are some nice features like using biometrics to quickly access information. I have yet to spend time taking photos, but I have heard from someone else that the camera is not as good as the old phone.",0
9,"Three stars for the phone but ONE star for return options. I'm returning the phone because I miss wireless charging and the always on display clock. For the price the phone would work for a lot of people but not me. I ordered a different brand that offered the features I wanted. I've been a loyal LG person for years, but they got out of the phone business and since I changed cell providers, I had to get a new phone. Turns out if you want to return a phone from Amazon, you have two choices. Take the phone to a Whole Foods store or an Amazon bookstore. No return thru the UPS store. There is no mention of this on the web page that I saw. I verified the return method with Amazon costumer care. If you don't have one of those places near where you live, like the same town, you are stuck with the phone. I'm lucky to have a Whole Foods store five miles from me so I will take it there. The other phone I bought from Amazon, before I was aware of their return method, I plan on keeping. I do not recommend buying a phone from Amazon until they offer more return options like UPS.",0
10,"I've always purchased budget phones and my TCL 30 SE phone battery swelled up and cracked the back of the case off. So decided to give the Samsung Galaxy A15 phone a try. I like the build quality of the phone it feels solid and with 5g data and amoled display it's worth the price. It has everything I want in a phone. I don't open a lot of web page tabs so it fast enough for me. It's the four years of Android upgrades that sold me on this phone. My last phone didn't last two years before the battery problem. I hope this phone last long enough to receive all the Android upgrade. The power button is a little hard to press, but the fingerprint sensor works great. I really like this phone and highly recommend this budget phone.
Note::
Taking a screenshot is difficult because you have to press the power button and the volume down button at same time. The power is so sunken down in the frame you have to use both hands which sucks. Put the feature in the drop down menu bar like other phones.",0
11,"I am enjoying my new Samsung A15 phone. It's a very good phone and transferring data over to this phone was easy. This was one of the best purchases I have ever made. My old phone was 4G and always freezing and cutting off. I needed a new phone and being on disability can be a hassle since I am living off of limited income, so thank you Amazon for the automatic payment plan option. Just one low down payment and 4 small monthly payments, I was able to get a new phone and the one I always wanted. 😀",0
12,"Great storage, very responsive, sleek-looking Samsung phone. Can run most apps with little to no issues. However, while the Samsung A15 5G is completely ready for RCS and Native Video Calling, it is locked out by default. If you try to contact ATT/T-Mobile/Sprint, they will tell you that only their carrier-branded phones support these features. The current workaround is to use Shizuku+System UI Tuner to enable IMS Settings to turn on Native Video Calling (Samsung/Green Phone app) as well as all the RCS features. It is a shame that these features are turned off by default because we already pay so much money for these phones and data plans, and now they add more restrictions. Very good phone for the price otherwise.",0
13,"A bit tricky to get on the first time, but they work incredibly well, This is the second phone I've bought one for. The first one outlasted the phone which aged out after five years. It was still protecting the phone as well as the first day I ever used it when the phone was replaced.
When it came time to get a case for the new phone, I never considered anything else. This one checks all the boxes.",1
14,"I had a galaxy s22U but broke it on deployment. I ordered this phone and it arrived in a week and a half. Great time for delivery to an APO.
I notice very little difference between my old phone and this one.",0
15,I have bought this unlocked Samsung Galaxy phone and I am happy besides sometimes hitting enter button after typing which sometimes close the window but I am ignoring it somehow and using it. Otherwise it's good phone and it never gets hot while charging or using it.,1
16,"I always need a backup phone. My main phone ( Moto stylus 5g) dropped and had to order a new screen. My backup phone died so, I bought this Galaxy A15 since it would get to me the next day. I thought getting a Galaxy would be great with the brand reputation. I realize this is entry level for this family of phones, but did expect a little better. Here is the good:
1. The Samsung UI is intuitive and is willing to take on tasks and minimize effort for logging in and anything related to accounts.
2. Setup was easy with the Samsung UI.
The not so good:
1. It has to think about loading something when you try to open an app. I was able to grab my laptop log in and start typing before it loaded the app.
2. It will say you are offline even when connected to WiFi or cell. You may have to close then relaunch the browser multiple times for it to load.
3. the UI gives you a message that you will have to reboot the phone often to keep it working correctly. I know a little about computers and know that the file system will apply updates and such to ensure it is working right however, I found I had to reboot this one multiple times in a day to get it to open apps or connect. There were no error messages or indications of hardware issues. It was new in the box.
4. I bought a Moto G 5G as a backup, which is in the same price range as the A15 and it; setup, connected and navigated apps without issues or delays. The performance difference was notable.
I have read many reviews with the same result from users regarding the A15.

I was able to install the new screen for my Stylus G, while it is slightly higher level than the A15, it had
no issues with speed or connectivity the same as the Moto G 5G.
Summary: The A15 performs lower than comparable phones so, if you are looking for a low mid range phone, other than a dedicated Samsung fan, it would benefit you to either upgrade to a higher level Galaxy or shop for a different brand in this price range.
Hope this helps.",0
17,"I paid for a new phone, Amazon sent me a used one. The box was open and crushed, and the block number list had a lot of numbers added to it. Messaging doesn't seem to work. Everything else is fine, I'm getting used to the latest software. The soundcard is good, which is what I care about and why I went back to Samsung.

After testing , it can't use Google's speed test and had a problem scrolling one of my emails; other speed tests and emails worked. This occurred on multiple browsers. My old Samsung phones used google's test and scrolled the same email without problem as usual. This probably displays a glitch in the latest Android or Samsung software. I'm hoping it's not about the phone's hardware.",0
18,Works well for low end phone.,1
19,Good quality and fits perfect,1
20,"I bought this for my son and so fat in two weeks he loves it. Battery life is longer than advertised. He charges it every 3 days or so. Loves watching crisp videos and playing video games. Fingerprint sensor works every-time so far. Sound is louder than my iphone 14 pro. Love the option for a wired headphone, there is also the option for bluetooth accessories. Lots of phone cases available for this model. Reason for three starts? Well there is some lag speed with having multiple apps open.",0
21,"I bought this phone to do live streams on YouTube. It does very well in the daytime but lacks at night.

It is a little slow if you have a bunch of apps on it. For a secondary/budget phone, this is a great deal (I got it for $170).

My primary is an A54 and I would recommend that over this phone. BUT... if you do decide to get the A15, understand that it is a budget phone that can do all the basic things you need.

Overall, for the price, it does have many features that are attractive. I would get a 128gb micro SD card that's A1, V30, and U1. It'll be decent for apps.

Edit: I wanted to mention that this DOES work with T-Mobile. If you want to check compatibility, go to your phone carrier and see if you can purchase the phone through them. If you can't, then that means the A15 is not supported.",0
22,"Very similar to older Samsung but was set up to only take three icons in width. Could not find setting to change so set it up similar to older phone. After about a week contacted Samsung about it and received a call back. After resetting to factory settings I could change the display to 4 or 5 wide. Then able to set up icons and widgets to give the desired spacing. I then had to reload all my apps and go through all the settings again.

All the other issues I have had have been with the changes from older software to the latest versions, not with the phone itself. Samsung did add extraneous apps, some of which could not be deleted so I did a force stop on them. The first update brought them back so had to turn off automatic updates, then allow or block updates individually since then.

Would prefer to have the 256 gig memory of the non-US veersion but did not want to give up the warranty. If they did not include the unwanted apps that would help the memory go further.

Had for a month, mostly satisfied.",0
23,"After having the Samsung galaxy A15 5g for over 6 months now I can say it's not a bad deal for under 200 bucks. The performance on it has been slower over the months, but nothing too bad yet. It has 128 gb of internal storage, which for me is plenty. The sound quality on the speaker isn't anything amazing, but it works well. Although I do hate the placement of it at the bottom of the phone, it gets covered easily and muffles the sound. The picture quality is pretty, way better than my last phone. The thing I probably love about it the most is the display. I didn't think I would care that much about the display, but every time I look at someone else's phone I only then realize how much of a difference it makes. All in all if your looking for a reliable phone under 200, this is probably the best deal.",1
24,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy, the description said unlocked. And compatible with my carrier which was MetroPCS. When I got the phone and try to activate it my carrier MetroPCS said it was locked by another carrier and wanted a $30 fee to unlock it. Or to call Amazon to see if they could call the carrier that it was locked by and have them unlock it. I had no success with that. So I returned the phone. I then but another Samsung phone of the same model, with the same description as being unlocked from Amazon. I bought a second replacement phone and that phone was also locked by another carrier. And a $30 fee was required to unlock it by my carrier. So both phones were locked when I bought them. If I would have been told that there was to be a unlock fee from my carrier in the first place I would have kept the first phone and just paid to have it unlocked. Not knowing this information from Amazon, and a incorrect description of phone and misinformation, cost me time and money for almost a month, waiting on a return of my money and in the meantime I had no phone. So phones that say unlocked are almost definitely locked. And a fee from your carrier will be needed to unlock it. And paid by the buyer. The phone I bought as a replacement after sending the first locked phone back was also locked. I ended up buying the same model Galaxy phone at a higher price , I also had to pay for unlock fee. The ram was lower, 4 gigs vs 6 gigs than the original one I purchased. So because of misinformation and bad description, the overall situation of the purchase was very very bad. The Galaxy phone itself seemed to be running fine so far. But because of low ram at 4 GB, it seems to lag when scrolling.",0
25,"This works great with Visible wireless.
As with any new phone the transfer of files & service is daunting. LOL. This was no exception. My older s10 older, fading battery barely made it thru the process. I would suggest using wireless mode to transfer & leave older phone charging! Nice phone. Working great. Getting used to the difference. There are some apps that were not compatible with this phone! I'll manage replacing those apps but the biggest disappointment is for my lionel wifi camera caboose! The apk/app isn't compatible! Very disappointing! I use my 10 inch tablet but now can't use this phone. I don't think I'd buy a more expensive phone for that apk but surprised it doesn't work. Who knows if it will work on a better phone! Same system no? Otherwise I'm tolerating it. Worth the upgrade. Looks like lionel is still working on this wireless technology. Hope they figure it out. These trains ain't cheap. Maybe this helps the next person?",0
26,This Samsung phone is just perfect!,1
27,It works great,1
28,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE BECAUSE I HAVE A SAMSUNG S22 THAT THE BATTERY DISCHARGES TO QUICKLY AND I HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY CHARGING THE DAMNED THING. THIS A-15 ADVERTISED A SUPER BATTERY AND I FIGURED IT WOULD BE AS GOOD AS MY MOTOROLLA G6 POWER I USED TO HAVE AND LOVED. TURNS OUT IT IS DECENT BUT THEIR BATTERY RATING IS OVER BLOWN AND THOUGH QUITE A LOT BETTER THAN THE SAMSUNG S-22 IT STILL DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE PERFORMANCE I USED TO GET OUT OF MY MOTOROLA. ALSO YOU NEED TO RESTART THIS PHONE EVERY COUPLE DAYS AS IT STARTS TO GET GLITCHY, LUCKILY AFTER RSTATS IT WORKS OK AGAIN. SO I CONSIDER THESE A DECENT ECONOMY PHONE BUT NOT A GREAT ONE.",0
29,My son loves Samsung phones connectivity was good. The weight is great. Screen is clear and the value for the money was A-OK.,1
30,Amazon did an excellent job and delivered this phone in hours and ordering it.,1
31,"I only got this phone as a temporary until I can get my z fold repaired. This has good memory, lots of features but the refresh rate is pretty damn slow. I guess I'm used to a fast refresh rate. This phone is slow to respond, slow to load pages. If you want a fast phone spend more than $400.",0
32,"I cannot believe this phone is this price! it comes already with 132gb memory plus expandable SD card! I really love Samsung, I bought an expensive Motorola (800 bucks) and yeah the screen is great and the camera, but this phone is definitely wayyyyy worth it for 1/4 the price. and actually the sound, whereas on Bluetooth or car , is better than other phones...

this can do anything that my other expensive phone can and more, because the newer phones do not have explandable memory!",1
33,Phone is slow and fingerprint sensor is really bad. Cheap phone that serves it's purpose. Makes me Miss my Motorola 5g ace. I'll be looking for something different soon because I can't stand the hiccups this thing has. Annoying really.,0
34,Very good phone and worth the price,1
35,"I bought this phone because of all the good reviews and that it was affordable. I had had bad experiences with Samsung phones in the past, but I thought maybe they had improved. I was disappointed.

Within a couple of days, when I was trying to type out texts, I found that even if I very carefully pushed on a letter that I wanted, another letter, or number, or word would show up in the text box. I would have to re-start the phone to get it to work again. And that was not all. Other times the screen would start jittering badly, or quickly shifting back and forth between two apps when I wasn't even touching it.
This behavior has persisted. Due to this problem, I have to re-start the phone on the average every two days, but there have been a few times whey I've had to do it three or four times in one day.

Also, I'm not sure why the default setting for the screen is ""gestures"". This was very frustrating because I could only remember a few basic gestures, so I could never do things like bring up the screen with all of the open apps, as well as having other things happen that I didn't want to happen when I tried certain swipe gestures. I finally got sick of this problem, and looked it up on the internet and found where there was a way to get three buttons at the bottom of the screen - one for ""back a screen"", one for the ""home"" screen"" and one to open the window allowing you to scroll through (and close) open apps individually - or close them all with one button.

The battery saving feature takes a while to get it right. This feature keeps you from over-charging it, and stops the charging when the battery gets to 85% full. For the first few weeks, this resulted in me sometimes running out of power before my day was through. This feature has some king of AI support, I think, and it has gotten better over time. It still says it only gets 85% full, but it usually lasts a whole day unless I am using it very heavily.

Otherwise, the phone seems to work well, but the screen problem is bad enough that I can only give this a two star rating.",0
36,"The phone is in its best condition I'm sure, but as I have owned the phone I have noticed a lot more pop-ups and just weird stuff happening that didn't happen on my last Samsung S10. It's like the phone has TikTok embroidered into the software somehow cuz it'll constantly give me pop-ups.",0
37,"This is a very nice phone. Samsung did a really good job on this one.

The build quality is solid. The plastic case is a matte iridescent deep blackish blue and does a good job at not showing fingerprints. The AMOLED screen has good colors and perfect deep blacks. The high capacity battery (5,000mAh) lasts 7-10 days with light usage before needing to recharge. The software is typical Samsung high-quality and the Samsung-built email app is still the best amongst Android phones. The fingerprint reader on the side unlocks the phone instantaneously. The charging port is USB-C. Speed-wise, the phone is plenty fast and doesn't lag. It has 5G cell phone connectivity but you can turn it off and use 4G to save on battery life. Networking also supports 2G (i.e. GSM) that can be turned on or off. Built-in storage is a whopping 128GB. Expansion-wise, the SIM tray accepts 2 SIM cards (i.e. this is indeed a dual-SIM phone), or 1 SIM card + 1 Micro-SD card. There is a headphone jack at the bottom, next to the charging port. The phone is quite big, i.e. the screen is huge, and it's rather heavy but so are most phones nowadays. It barely fits in my pants pockets.

This is marketed as an entry-level phone, but honestly, it has such much memory, long battery life, fingerprint unlock, 3 good cameras, dual-SIM, Micro-SD expansion, headphone jack, USB C, great software support, future-proof updates, and is quite fast, so you may wonder why you'd ever need to buy anything more expensive.

Overall, great modern phone at a reasonable price ($200) that should work well for most people and last a long time.",1
38,"Why does Samsung have to add a bunch of junk on top of the very capable Android base OS?
This really downgrades the Android experience for me.
Even the higher-end Samsung phones seem to suffer from the manufacturer trying to ""fix"" something that isn't broken by installing crapware.
No more Samsung phones for me.",0
39,"Good phone for a low cost. Everything transfered smoothly. I have T- Mobile and I'm in the USA. Good photos and videos. Smooth scrolling. Not too many crazy updates. I like the ability to remove most preinstalled apps as well. Battery life is great.
Downfalls are minimal. *Side on/off button is flush with the side and takes longer to locate.
*screenshot are rather difficult with the palm swipe. It takes quite a few tries, loosing what you want to screenshot happens often. As an older person I screenshot things I can't read so I can zoom in. I try to avoid that now.
*No sd card storage to remove or replace. I miss that, even though the phone has lots of available room. I use to save the sd cards for personal back up photos.
*Sim card slot looks as if it won't securely hold in the tray. Isn't a tight fit, but suprisingly it does work with some patience.
A month into use,
It's a good phone so far!",0
40,"Good screen. Phone has everything you need except for: Speed and good camera.
It's Slow. R---E---A----L-----L----------Y----------S--------L------------O--------------------------W.
Camera produces blurry photos indoors. It's SLOW, low res, and glitchy.
Video records with visual glitches. RAM shortage is palpable.
Apps take time to load. Switching between apps is a pain.
Inputs from your finger are missed 20% of the time.
Imagine being in a situation where you need to text your family, look up a thing or two online, and turn off your house AC. This will TAKE TIME. There is a palpable gap between every action-reaction. So, Great attempt, but the CPU should have been faster. It's too much of a compromise at any price, really, for 2024. The phone is good for users with lower than average knowledge of smartphones. It's visibly slower than any other phone you have touched. I do not recommend it, but I thank Samsung for the effort. A 50% faster CPU seems necessary. A faster camera as well. But $200 is unreal. So, do it if you have to, but don't do it :)",0
41,It works as expected. Used Sim card from old phone.,0
42,"The phone is really nice and screen is sharp. Works fast enough. Pictures I thought would be a little better quality but it does do alot of cool features. Slow motion, hyperlapse, professional ect.
I did buy a separate screen protector and case. Then realized I also needed to buy a new plug cause they only sent a charging cable with both ends being usb c and no usb a? That all my plugs have. With what I had it said it would take 69 hours to charge. That's why missing 1 star",0
43,"When it's good it is very good. This phone requires a restart every 2-3 days to keep it getting a signal. Apps were a bit weird for a while and found it was user error.
The screen is VERY sensitive to touch, and I hate to try and lower it. Just be aware it is real touchy.",1
44,"Got this to replace my A13 which I was happy with but broke the glass.
